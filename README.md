## Description

This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End Development Certificate. It is built with a link to a database of quotes through an API. The design is using the circuit board pattern that is shared by multiple projects. I refined the style after finishing an advanced CSS course, adding transparency and box-shadow, as well as animation to the buttons. It is fully responsive, the text will change size depending on the size of the screen.
